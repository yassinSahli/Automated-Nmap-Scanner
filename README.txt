This Nmap Scanner is a network discovery tool that uses raw IP packets in novel ways to
determine what hosts are available on the network and many other useful information for
pentesters, making it automated is a must.
In simple words, this tool will invite the user to choose exactly what kind of scan he wants to
run, saving him time and energy displaying the needed results in an organized way.
The delivered work might also be improved by adding other features and types of scan.


In the short term, the delivered work might be improved by not only adding other options to
automate other types of scans, but also turning the written scripts for the Automated Nmap
Scanner tool to a desktop Application where the user logs in and that will be done by adding
a secure database holding userâ€™s information and other archived logs.



Enjoy !
